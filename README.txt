Enables child-site posts on a network to be displayed in the main site.

== Description ==

This is a multisite plugin.

The plugin creates a network-wide tag in all post_tag taxonomy of each site.

Tagged posts are made available for a theme developer to display on the home site.

Furthermore, the home site admin dashboard has a new submenu Posts->Network Wide (the name of your network-wide tag) which allows the admin to manually order the network-wide posts with a drag and drop interface.

This plugin was originally designed for a client site.  The site is a multi-resort group of hotels.  Each hotel has special offers through the season.  Each special offer is promoted on the home site.  Special offers need to be pushed up to the top of the page at various moments during the season.  This plugin allows them to do so.

The plugin is compatible with the excellent [PolyLang](https://wordpress.org/plugins/polylang/) multi-language plugin.

**Main Features of this plugin**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I display the network-wide post in a page? =

The functionality is exposed through a single function `get_network_wide_posts()`,
which returns an array of posts with a limited number of meta-fields, which are,

- `post_id` the id of the post
- `post_title` the title of the post
- `post_excerpt` the excerpt of the post
- `post_url` the permalink of the post
- `thumb_url` the thumbnail image URL of the post
- `blog_id` the id of the blog to which this post belongs to

Here is the example of how to use it in a page template
`
$nwposts = array();
if(function_exists('get_network_wide_posts')){
  $nwposts = get_network_wide_posts();
  foreach($nwposts as $post){
    ?>
<article id="post-<?php echo $post['post_id']; ?>" >
  <a class="post-thumbnail" href="<?php echo $post['post_url'];?>" >
		<img src="<?php echo $post['thumb_url'];?>" class="attachment-post-thumbnail" alt="<?php echo $post['post_title'];?>">
  </a>
	<header class="entry-header">
		<h1><?php echo $post['post_title'];?></h1>
	</header><!-- .entry-header -->
	<div class="entry-content">
		<?php echo $post['post_excerpt'];?>
	</div><!-- .entry-content -->
  </article><!-- #post-## -->
<?php
  }
}
?>

You can order the post as per the default published date, the slug or opt for a manual order.
